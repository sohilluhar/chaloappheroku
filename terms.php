                            We are the data controller in relation to our Platform and are responsible for your personal
                            data. Please refer to Clause 12 and our privacy policy which is available
                            at for information about what personal data
                            we collect and what we do with it. It is important that you read our privacy policy, which
                            may be updated from time to time, and understand how we use your information and the rights
                            that you have about your information.

                            If we have to contact you, we will do so by telephone or by writing to you at the email
                            address or postal address you provided to us. 

                            When we use the words "writing" or "written" in these terms, this includes emails.

                            Our contract with you

                            You may place orders with us as instructed on our Platform. Our acceptance of your order
                            will take place when we email you to accept it, at which point a contract will come into
                            existence between you and us. 

                            If we are unable to accept your order, we will let you know in writing and will not charge
                            you for the Product ordered. This might be because:

                            the Product ordered is out of stock;

                            there are unexpected limits on our resources which we could not reasonably plan for;

                            we have identified an error in the price or description of the Product; or 

                            we are unable to meet a delivery deadline you have specified. 

                            We will assign an order number to each order. Please tell us the order number whenever you
                            contact us about your order.

                            Our Platform is solely for the promotion of our Products in Hong Kong. 

                            Your rights to make changes

                            If you wish to make a change to the Product you have ordered, please contact us. We have
                            full discretion whether or not to accept the changes. We will let you know about any changes
                            to the price of the product, the timing of supply or anything else which would be necessary
                            as a result of your requested change and ask you to confirm whether you wish to go ahead
                            with the change. If we cannot make the change or the consequences of making the change are
                            unacceptable to you, you may want to end the contract (see Clause 7 - Your rights to end the
                            contract).

                            Changes to our product or these terms

                            We may make minor changes to the Product from time to time in order to: 

                            reflect changes in relevant laws and regulatory requirements; and

                            implement minor technical adjustments and improvements, for example to address a security
                            threat. These changes will not affect your use of the product.

                            If we make significant changes to these terms or the Product, we will notify you and you may
                            then contact us to end the contract before the changes take effect and receive a refund for
                            any</p>
